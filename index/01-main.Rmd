# Introduction

## STOCK STRUCTURE AND LIFE HISTORY

Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) is a relatively short-lived, fast-growing member of the family Gadidae. Other common names in British Columbia (BC) include grey cod (or gray cod). Populations of Pacific Cod are distributed from California, throughout the waters of BC, Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea to Russia, Korea, Japan and China [@hart1973]. Maximum observed age in British Columbia is around 10-11 years [@westrheim1996, this document], while a maximum age of approximately 13 years has been reported for Alaskan stocks [@roberson2001]. Maximum length recorded in British Columbia is 100 cm [@hart1973], although some larger specimens have been observed in Alaska and Russia [@westrheim1996]. Pacific Cod are demersal spawners, with several studies reporting that spawning most likely occurs during February to March. A comprehensive review of the biology, life history and distribution of Pacific Cod in British Columbia is provided by @westrheim1996.

Four stocks of Pacific Cod are defined for management purposes on the BC coast: Strait of Georgia (4B); West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD); Queen Charlotte Sound (5AB); and Hecate Strait (5CD). This study focuses on the populations in Queen Charlotte Sound combined with Hecate Strait (5ABCD) and the West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD) (Figure XX).

Recent genetic analyses have identified a distinction between North American and Asian Pacific Cod populations, and have shown some evidence for distinction between Alaskan populations and those south of Dixon Entrance in British Columbia (reviewed in Appendix XX). There is also evidence that fish taken off the coast of Washington and the west coast of Vancouver Island may be distinct from fish sampled within the Strait of Georgia or Puget Sound. However, linkages, if any, among stocks in BC and those in Alaska remain poorly understood. To date it is uncertain whether genetic population structure exists within BC waters (Appendix XX).

Population dynamics of Pacific Cod in BC have been characterized by large variations in abundance, based on reconstructions driven by fishery catch rates, most likely as a function of large recruitment events followed by large opportunistic fishery catches. However, other hypotheses, including predator-prey cycles, density-dependent growth and mortality,and northward water transport have also been proposed (reviewed by @westrheim1996). Natural mortality has been estimated as high as 0.6 - 0.65 y-1 in some stock assessments (e.g., @fournier1983; @sinclair2005) although lower estimates (~0.4 y-1) have also been obtained [@sinclair2001]. The combination of apparently volatile dynamics with short life span and high natural mortality suggests periods of over/under harvest could result if harvest strategies are not designed to be robust to these features. However, in the context of the BC integrated groundfish fishery, constraints imposed by quotas for other species mean that single-species considerations alone do not always dictate the best harvest strategy.

## ECOSYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS

### Prey and Predators

Pacific Cod are omnivores, eating a diet of mainly marine invertebrates, including amphipods, euphausiids, shrimp and crabs. At around 50-55 cm they also become piscivorous, with Pacific Sand Lance (*Ammodytes hexapterus*) and Pacific Herring (*Clupea harengus pallasi*) becoming important components of the diet [@westrheim1996]. Juvenile Sablefish (*Anoplopoma fimbria*) and adult Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*) have also been reported in the diet of Pacific Cod off the west coast of Vancouver Island @ware1986. Pacific Cod have been reported in the diets of Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*), North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (*Squalus suckleyi*), sea birds, seals and sealions @westrheim1996.

@walters1986 demonstrated a Pacific Cod-Herring predator-prey interaction in Hecate Strait, in contrast to @ware1986. Simulation models were developed by @walters1986 to explicitly model the effects of Pacific Cod predation on Pacific Herring. The simulations were able to mimic recruitment trends in both species. @walters1986 concluded that availability of Pacific Herring prey could be an important driver of Pacific Cod production in Hecate Strait, and, similarly, that Pacific Cod predation could be a significant driver of Pacific Herring abundance. These authors acknowledged that there are alternative hypotheses for cycles in abundance of Pacific Cod and Pacific Herring (e.g., environmental forcing; see below) and suggested that large-scale management experiments may be the only way to distinguish among competing hypotheses.

### Environment

A large number of studies have investigated linkages between recruitment and environmental indices for Pacific Cod in Hecate Strait. The dominant hypothesis is an inverse relationship between recruitment and northward water transport (i.e., northward advection of larvae) (@tyler1986; @tyler1991). Northward water transport has been shown to be positively correlated with mean annual sea level at Prince Rupert during the spawning season, which in turn has been used as an explanatory variable for recruitment by a number of authors [@fournier1983]; [@sinclair2001]; @sinclair2005-2; @sinclair2005). @westrheim1996 provides a review of the major alternative studies.

### Other species

Other species caught with Pacific Cod include Arrowtooth Flounder (*Atheresthes stomias*), Yellowtail Rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*), Pacific Ocean Perch (*S. alutus*), Lingcod (*Ophiodon elongatus*), Silvergray Rockfish (*S. brevispinis*), English Sole (*Parophrys vetulus*) and Big Skate (*Raja binoculata*) (Figure XX). Vessels catching Pacific Cod must hold quota for all quota species encountered. Since 1996, there has been 100% at-sea observer coverage on commercial bottom trawl vessels in BC. At-sea releases are recorded by observers and counted against the vessel's quota, according to agreed-upon discard mortality rates published in the integrated fishery management plan [@dfo2015]).
