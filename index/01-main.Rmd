# Introduction

## STOCK STRUCTURE AND LIFE HISTORY

Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) is a relatively short-lived, fast-growing member of the family Gadidae. Other common names in British Columbia (BC) include grey cod (or gray cod). Populations of Pacific Cod are distributed from California, throughout the waters of BC, Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea to Russia, Korea, Japan and China [@hart1973]. Maximum observed age in British Columbia is around 10-11 years [@westrheim1996, this document], while a maximum age of approximately 13 years has been reported for Alaskan stocks [@roberson2001]. Maximum length recorded in British Columbia is 100 cm [@hart1973], although some larger specimens have been observed in Alaska and Russia [@westrheim1996]. Pacific Cod are demersal spawners, with several studies reporting that spawning most likely occurs during February to March. A comprehensive review of the biology, life history and distribution of Pacific Cod in British Columbia is provided by @westrheim1996.

Four stocks of Pacific Cod are defined for management purposes on the BC coast: Strait of Georgia (4B); West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD); Queen Charlotte Sound (5AB); and Hecate Strait (5CD). This study focuses on the populations in Queen Charlotte Sound combined with Hecate Strait (5ABCD) and the West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD) (Figure XX).

Recent genetic analyses have identified a distinction between North American and Asian Pacific Cod populations, and have shown some evidence for distinction between Alaskan populations and those south of Dixon Entrance in British Columbia (reviewed in Appendix XX). There is also evidence that fish taken off the coast of Washington and the west coast of Vancouver Island may be distinct from fish sampled within the Strait of Georgia or Puget Sound. However, linkages, if any, among stocks in BC and those in Alaska remain poorly understood. To date it is uncertain whether genetic population structure exists within BC waters (Appendix XX).

Population dynamics of Pacific Cod in BC have been characterized by large variations in abundance, based on reconstructions driven by fishery catch rates, most likely as a function of large recruitment events followed by large opportunistic fishery catches. However, other hypotheses, including predator-prey cycles, density-dependent growth and mortality,and northward water transport have also been proposed (reviewed by @westrheim1996). Natural mortality has been estimated as high as 0.6 - 0.65 y-1 in some stock assessments (e.g., @fournier1983; @sinclair2005) although lower estimates (~0.4 y-1) have also been obtained [@sinclair2001]. The combination of apparently volatile dynamics with short life span and high natural mortality suggests periods of over/under harvest could result if harvest strategies are not designed to be robust to these features. However, in the context of the BC integrated groundfish fishery, constraints imposed by quotas for other species mean that single-species considerations alone do not always dictate the best harvest strategy.

## ECOSYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS

### Prey and Predators

Pacific Cod are omnivores, eating a diet of mainly marine invertebrates, including amphipods, euphausiids, shrimp and crabs. At around 50-55 cm they also become piscivorous, with Pacific Sand Lance (*Ammodytes hexapterus*) and Pacific Herring (*Clupea harengus pallasi*) becoming important components of the diet [@westrheim1996]. Juvenile Sablefish (*Anoplopoma fimbria*) and adult Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*) have also been reported in the diet of Pacific Cod off the west coast of Vancouver Island @ware1986. Pacific Cod have been reported in the diets of Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*), North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (*Squalus suckleyi*), sea birds, seals and sealions @westrheim1996.

@walters1986 demonstrated a Pacific Cod-Herring predator-prey interaction in Hecate Strait, in contrast to @ware1986. Simulation models were developed by @walters1986 to explicitly model the effects of Pacific Cod predation on Pacific Herring. The simulations were able to mimic recruitment trends in both species. @walters1986 concluded that availability of Pacific Herring prey could be an important driver of Pacific Cod production in Hecate Strait, and, similarly, that Pacific Cod predation could be a significant driver of Pacific Herring abundance. These authors acknowledged that there are alternative hypotheses for cycles in abundance of Pacific Cod and Pacific Herring (e.g., environmental forcing; see below) and suggested that large-scale management experiments may be the only way to distinguish among competing hypotheses.

### Environment

A large number of studies have investigated linkages between recruitment and environmental indices for Pacific Cod in Hecate Strait. The dominant hypothesis is an inverse relationship between recruitment and northward water transport (i.e., northward advection of larvae) (@tyler1986; @tyler1991). Northward water transport has been shown to be positively correlated with mean annual sea level at Prince Rupert during the spawning season, which in turn has been used as an explanatory variable for recruitment by a number of authors [@fournier1983]; [@sinclair2001]; @sinclair2005-2; @sinclair2005). @westrheim1996 provides a review of the major alternative studies.

### Other species

Other species caught with Pacific Cod include Arrowtooth Flounder (*Atheresthes stomias*), Yellowtail Rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*), Pacific Ocean Perch (*S. alutus*), Lingcod (*Ophiodon elongatus*), Silvergray Rockfish (*S. brevispinis*), English Sole (*Parophrys vetulus*) and Big Skate (*Raja binoculata*) (Figure XX). Vessels catching Pacific Cod must hold quota for all quota species encountered. Since 1996, there has been 100% at-sea observer coverage on commercial bottom trawl vessels in BC. At-sea releases are recorded by observers and counted against the vessel's quota, according to agreed-upon discard mortality rates published in the integrated fishery management plan [@dfo2015]).

## FISHERIES

Pacific Cod in British Columbia are caught almost entirely in the groundfish bottom trawl fishery, which is part of BC's integrated groundfish fishery. Pacific Cod is one of the principal target species of the trawl fishery in Hecate Strait. Currently, the majority of the BC Pacific Cod catch is taken from in Hecate Strait (Area 5CD) (Figure XX).

Pacific Cod are distributed throughout Area 5CD at depths mainly less than 150 m. Pacific Cod density, measured by commercial catch per unit effort (see Appendix XX), appears to be highest over the Two Peaks/Butterworth, White Rocks, Shell Ground, Reef Island, and Horseshoe fishing grounds (Figure XX). In Queen Charlotte Sound (Area 5AB), Pacific Cod are caught mainly around the edge of Goose Island Bank in Area 5B and on Cape Scott and Mexicana Banks, north of Vancouver Island, in Area 5A (Figure XX). The depth range of capture is approximately 60--160 m. Annual reported catches of Pacific Cod in both Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound have shown considerable variability since the beginning of the time series in 1956 (Figure XX, Tables XX and XX).

In Hecate Strait (Figure XX), major peaks in catches (landings plus estimated discards) occurred in 1958 (5,702 t), 1965 and 1966 (8,870 t and 9,156 t), 1979 (5,736 t), 1987 (9,542 t), and 1991 (7,747 t). These peak years may be contrasted with years of low catches in 1961 (1,528 t), 1970 and 1971 (1,188 t and 1,333 t), 1985 (1,053 t), and the minimum on record in 2001 (214 t). Reported catches have increased since 2001 to 701 t in 2012, although it should be noted that recent low catches are partially a result of lowered quotas in the early to mid-2000s. Catch was reported by USA vessels from 1956 to 1978. The estimated USA portion of the total catch was approximately 15% over these years (Table XX).

Catches in Queen Charlotte Sound (Figure 3b) also showed significant variability over the time series. Major peaks in catches occurred in1957 (2,625 t), 1965 (1,983 t), 1972 and 1975 (2,415 t and 2,470 t), 1987 (3,209 t), and 1991 (2,206 t). Low catch years included 1961 (259 t), 1970 (278 t), 1983 (184 t), 2000 (67 t) and the lowest year on record 2008 (35 t). Significant catches were reported by USA vessels from 1956 to 1980. The estimated USA portion of the total catch was approximately 50% over these years (Table XX).

Prior to the introduction of at-sea observer coverage in 1996, estimates of at-sea releases (discards) for the period 1956-1995 were obtained from fishing logbooks (Figure XX). These estimates are considered an underestimate of the actual releases. Estimates in years following the introduction of 100% at-sea observer coverage in 1996 can be considered to be more accurate. Since 1996, the proportions of estimated discards have been considerably higher than in years before at-sea observers (Figure XX), especially in Queen Charlotte Sound, largely as a result of reduced total catches. Pacific Cod can be legally discarded by trawlers in BC. However, on-board observers first estimate the quantity being discarded and it is assigned a discard mortality rate which is counted against the vessel's Pacific Cod quota. Therefore, in addition to greater accuracy in reporting of discards since 1996, incentives to avoid discarding have also been greater.

Japanese and Soviet vessels also trawled in waters off BC in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These vessels were mainly targeting rockfish and likely at depths greater than 150 m. The bycatch of Pacific Cod in these fisheries is, however, unknown. Given uncertainty in foreign catches and discards in the earlier parts of the time series, total catch estimates should be considered underestimates prior to 1996.

Bottom trawl fishing effort has been somewhat cyclic in both areas, especially in Hecate Strait (Figure XX). Total effort of all trawl vessels has declined in both areas since peaking in 1993 (Hecate Strait) and 1995 (Queen Charlotte Sound). A detailed analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE) is provided in Appendix B. As noted by Sinclair (2000), however, there are a number of problems with the use of commercial catch per unit effort data as an index of biomass for Pacific Cod. It has been suggested that changes in the management regime from an unrestricted fishery prior to 1992, to the introduction of TACs (1992-1996) and then to Individual Vessel Quotas (IVQs) (1997-present), as well as several increases in mesh size, have affected the underlying relationship between commercial CPUE and abundance, and the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality. In recent years of lower Pacific Cod quotas, many fishing masters report actively avoiding Pacific Cod to prevent their Pacific Cod quota being exceeded before catching available quotas for other species. @fournier1983 noted similar problems with relating fishing effort to fishing mortality for this fishery. @sinclair2001 analyzed the spatial distribution of fishing effort in Hecate Strait and reported that there had been little fishing over Butterworth, White Rock, Bonilla and Horseshoe grounds (Figure XX), which had previously been locations with the highest CPUE. They also cited industry reports that key Pacific Cod fishing grounds had been avoided to preserve Pacific Cod quota for bycatch in other fisheries [@sinclair2001]. We do not provide a detailed analysis of spatial fishing effort in this document but recommend it as an avenue of future research to improve understanding of the CPUE data and drivers of fishing effort (e.g., @branch2008).
