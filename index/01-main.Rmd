# Introduction

## STOCK STRUCTURE AND LIFE HISTORY

Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) is a relatively short-lived, fast-growing member of the family Gadidae. Other common names in British Columbia (BC) include grey cod (or gray cod). Populations of Pacific Cod are distributed from California, throughout the waters of BC, Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea to Russia, Korea, Japan and China [@hart1973]. Maximum observed age in British Columbia is around 10-11 years [@westrheim1996, this document], while a maximum age of approximately 13 years has been reported for Alaskan stocks [@roberson2001]. Maximum length recorded in British Columbia is 100 cm [@hart1973], although some larger specimens have been observed in Alaska and Russia [@westrheim1996]. Pacific Cod are demersal spawners, with several studies reporting that spawning most likely occurs during February to March. A comprehensive review of the biology, life history and distribution of Pacific Cod in British Columbia is provided by @westrheim1996.

Four stocks of Pacific Cod are defined for management purposes on the BC coast: Strait of Georgia (4B); West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD); Queen Charlotte Sound (5AB); and Hecate Strait (5CD). This study focuses on the populations in Queen Charlotte Sound combined with Hecate Strait (5ABCD) and the West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD) (Figure XX).

Recent genetic analyses have identified a distinction between North American and Asian Pacific Cod populations, and have shown some evidence for distinction between Alaskan populations and those south of Dixon Entrance in British Columbia (reviewed in Appendix XX). There is also evidence that fish taken off the coast of Washington and the west coast of Vancouver Island may be distinct from fish sampled within the Strait of Georgia or Puget Sound. However, linkages, if any, among stocks in BC and those in Alaska remain poorly understood. To date it is uncertain whether genetic population structure exists within BC waters (Appendix XX).

Population dynamics of Pacific Cod in BC have been characterized by large variations in abundance, based on reconstructions driven by fishery catch rates, most likely as a function of large recruitment events followed by large opportunistic fishery catches. However, other hypotheses, including predator-prey cycles, density-dependent growth and mortality,and northward water transport have also been proposed (reviewed by @westrheim1996). Natural mortality has been estimated as high as 0.6 - 0.65 y-1 in some stock assessments (e.g., @fournier1983; @sinclair2005) although lower estimates (~0.4 y-1) have also been obtained [@sinclair2001]. The combination of apparently volatile dynamics with short life span and high natural mortality suggests periods of over/under harvest could result if harvest strategies are not designed to be robust to these features. However, in the context of the BC integrated groundfish fishery, constraints imposed by quotas for other species mean that single-species considerations alone do not always dictate the best harvest strategy.

## ECOSYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS

### Prey and Predators

Pacific Cod are omnivores, eating a diet of mainly marine invertebrates, including amphipods, euphausiids, shrimp and crabs. At around 50-55 cm they also become piscivorous, with Pacific Sand Lance (*Ammodytes hexapterus*) and Pacific Herring (*Clupea harengus pallasi*) becoming important components of the diet [@westrheim1996]. Juvenile Sablefish (*Anoplopoma fimbria*) and adult Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*) have also been reported in the diet of Pacific Cod off the west coast of Vancouver Island @ware1986. Pacific Cod have been reported in the diets of Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*), North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (*Squalus suckleyi*), sea birds, seals and sealions @westrheim1996.

@walters1986 demonstrated a Pacific Cod-Herring predator-prey interaction in Hecate Strait, in contrast to @ware1986. Simulation models were developed by @walters1986 to explicitly model the effects of Pacific Cod predation on Pacific Herring. The simulations were able to mimic recruitment trends in both species. @walters1986 concluded that availability of Pacific Herring prey could be an important driver of Pacific Cod production in Hecate Strait, and, similarly, that Pacific Cod predation could be a significant driver of Pacific Herring abundance. These authors acknowledged that there are alternative hypotheses for cycles in abundance of Pacific Cod and Pacific Herring (e.g., environmental forcing; see below) and suggested that large-scale management experiments may be the only way to distinguish among competing hypotheses.

### Environment

A large number of studies have investigated linkages between recruitment and environmental indices for Pacific Cod in Hecate Strait. The dominant hypothesis is an inverse relationship between recruitment and northward water transport (i.e., northward advection of larvae) (@tyler1986; @tyler1991). Northward water transport has been shown to be positively correlated with mean annual sea level at Prince Rupert during the spawning season, which in turn has been used as an explanatory variable for recruitment by a number of authors [@fournier1983]; [@sinclair2001]; @sinclair2005-2; @sinclair2005). @westrheim1996 provides a review of the major alternative studies.

### Other species

Other species caught with Pacific Cod include Arrowtooth Flounder (*Atheresthes stomias*), Yellowtail Rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*), Pacific Ocean Perch (*S. alutus*), Lingcod (*Ophiodon elongatus*), Silvergray Rockfish (*S. brevispinis*), English Sole (*Parophrys vetulus*) and Big Skate (*Raja binoculata*) (Figure XX). Vessels catching Pacific Cod must hold quota for all quota species encountered. Since 1996, there has been 100% at-sea observer coverage on commercial bottom trawl vessels in BC. At-sea releases are recorded by observers and counted against the vessel's quota, according to agreed-upon discard mortality rates published in the integrated fishery management plan [@dfo2015]).

## FISHERIES

Pacific Cod in British Columbia are caught almost entirely in the groundfish bottom trawl fishery, which is part of BC's integrated groundfish fishery. Pacific Cod is one of the principal target species of the trawl fishery in Hecate Strait. Currently, the majority of the BC Pacific Cod catch is taken from in Hecate Strait (Area 5CD) (Figure XX).

Pacific Cod are distributed throughout Area 5CD at depths mainly less than 150 m. Pacific Cod density, measured by commercial catch per unit effort (see Appendix XX), appears to be highest over the Two Peaks/Butterworth, White Rocks, Shell Ground, Reef Island, and Horseshoe fishing grounds (Figure XX). In Queen Charlotte Sound (Area 5AB), Pacific Cod are caught mainly around the edge of Goose Island Bank in Area 5B and on Cape Scott and Mexicana Banks, north of Vancouver Island, in Area 5A (Figure XX). The depth range of capture is approximately 60--160 m. Annual reported catches of Pacific Cod in both Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound have shown considerable variability since the beginning of the time series in 1956 (Figure XX, Tables XX and XX).

In Hecate Strait (Figure XX), major peaks in catches (landings plus estimated discards) occurred in 1958 (5,702 t), 1965 and 1966 (8,870 t and 9,156 t), 1979 (5,736 t), 1987 (9,542 t), and 1991 (7,747 t). These peak years may be contrasted with years of low catches in 1961 (1,528 t), 1970 and 1971 (1,188 t and 1,333 t), 1985 (1,053 t), and the minimum on record in 2001 (214 t). Reported catches have increased since 2001 to 701 t in 2012, although it should be noted that recent low catches are partially a result of lowered quotas in the early to mid-2000s. Catch was reported by USA vessels from 1956 to 1978. The estimated USA portion of the total catch was approximately 15% over these years (Table XX).

Catches in Queen Charlotte Sound (Figure 3b) also showed significant variability over the time series. Major peaks in catches occurred in1957 (2,625 t), 1965 (1,983 t), 1972 and 1975 (2,415 t and 2,470 t), 1987 (3,209 t), and 1991 (2,206 t). Low catch years included 1961 (259 t), 1970 (278 t), 1983 (184 t), 2000 (67 t) and the lowest year on record 2008 (35 t). Significant catches were reported by USA vessels from 1956 to 1980. The estimated USA portion of the total catch was approximately 50% over these years (Table XX).

Prior to the introduction of at-sea observer coverage in 1996, estimates of at-sea releases (discards) for the period 1956-1995 were obtained from fishing logbooks (Figure XX). These estimates are considered an underestimate of the actual releases. Estimates in years following the introduction of 100% at-sea observer coverage in 1996 can be considered to be more accurate. Since 1996, the proportions of estimated discards have been considerably higher than in years before at-sea observers (Figure XX), especially in Queen Charlotte Sound, largely as a result of reduced total catches. Pacific Cod can be legally discarded by trawlers in BC. However, on-board observers first estimate the quantity being discarded and it is assigned a discard mortality rate which is counted against the vessel's Pacific Cod quota. Therefore, in addition to greater accuracy in reporting of discards since 1996, incentives to avoid discarding have also been greater.

Japanese and Soviet vessels also trawled in waters off BC in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These vessels were mainly targeting rockfish and likely at depths greater than 150 m. The bycatch of Pacific Cod in these fisheries is, however, unknown. Given uncertainty in foreign catches and discards in the earlier parts of the time series, total catch estimates should be considered underestimates prior to 1996.

Bottom trawl fishing effort has been somewhat cyclic in both areas, especially in Hecate Strait (Figure XX). Total effort of all trawl vessels has declined in both areas since peaking in 1993 (Hecate Strait) and 1995 (Queen Charlotte Sound). A detailed analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE) is provided in Appendix B. As noted by Sinclair (2000), however, there are a number of problems with the use of commercial catch per unit effort data as an index of biomass for Pacific Cod. It has been suggested that changes in the management regime from an unrestricted fishery prior to 1992, to the introduction of TACs (1992-1996) and then to Individual Vessel Quotas (IVQs) (1997-present), as well as several increases in mesh size, have affected the underlying relationship between commercial CPUE and abundance, and the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality. In recent years of lower Pacific Cod quotas, many fishing masters report actively avoiding Pacific Cod to prevent their Pacific Cod quota being exceeded before catching available quotas for other species. @fournier1983 noted similar problems with relating fishing effort to fishing mortality for this fishery. @sinclair2001 analyzed the spatial distribution of fishing effort in Hecate Strait and reported that there had been little fishing over Butterworth, White Rock, Bonilla and Horseshoe grounds (Figure XX), which had previously been locations with the highest CPUE. They also cited industry reports that key Pacific Cod fishing grounds had been avoided to preserve Pacific Cod quota for bycatch in other fisheries [@sinclair2001]. We do not provide a detailed analysis of spatial fishing effort in this document but recommend it as an avenue of future research to improve understanding of the CPUE data and drivers of fishing effort (e.g., @branch2008).

## MANAGEMENT HISTORY

The history of Pacific Cod management from 1984 to 2013 is summarized in Tables XX--XX. The tables list total allowable catches (TACs), landings and carryovers, area closures and mesh restrictions.

Groundfish fisheries were managed by calendar year until 1996. Beginning in 1997-98 the fishing year changed to April 1--March 31. In 2010--2011 the fishing year was changed again to February 21 to February 20. Throughout this document, fishing years are defined as beginning April 1 for all years, and are referenced by starting year, e.g., fishing year 1997 runs from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998.

### Area 5AB: Queen Charlotte Sound

Annual TACs were introduced for Pacific Cod in Queen Charlotte Sound in fishing year 1997 (Table XX). Before 2005, there was no scientific advice for this area and the TAC was initially established at 260 t, which was the low end of the range of observed catches [@sinclair2005]. The TAC remained unchanged until 2004 when it was increased to 390 t based on advice from the fishing industry to Fisheries Management that Pacific Cod abundance had increased. There were also carryover amounts in the 1999-2004 fishing years. Between 1997 and 2002, the fishery did not catch the TAC (plus carryover) in each year, with a low of 18% taken in 2000 and a high of 56% in 2002. The TAC plus carryover was exceeded by 16% in 2003. The TAC remained at 390 t from 2004 until 2010. In 2010 the quota was exceeded by 22% and in 2011 the TAC was increased to 590 t.
Other management measures have been used to control the Pacific Cod fishery in Area 5AB. Voluntary increases in mesh size for various portions of Queen Charlotte Sound were suggested in 2007 for vessels fishing shallower than 60 fm. This was then regulated in 2011 (Table XX).

### Area 5CD: Hecate Strait

Annual TACs were introduced in the 5CDE area in 1992 [@sinclair2005]. Catches in Area 5E (West Coast Haida Gwaii) have been negligible and we do not further discuss this area. The original Area 5CD 1992 TAC was 3,400 t and landings that year exceeded this figure by 48% (Table XX). The TAC was increased to 5,100 t in 1993, and then reduced in steps to 1,000 t in 1998. The low catch in relation to the TAC in 1999 led to a carryover of 283 t in 2000. The TAC was reduced to 200 t in 2001 due to very low assessed stock biomass [@sinclair2000] and no carryovers were allowed. The TAC was maintained at 200 t in 2002. The 2003 TAC was initially set at 200 t but results from the Hecate Strait Pacific Cod monitoring survey, commercial CPUE, and input from the trawl fleet indicated that Pacific Cod abundance had increased in the area. Consequently, the TAC was increased to 400 t in the winter of 2003 and the TAC was maintained at 400 t for 2004. The TAC was increased to 800 t in 2005 and remained at that level until 2009. In 2010 the TAC was increased to 1,200 t and has remained at that level until the present.

Other management measures have been used to control the Pacific Cod fishery in Area 5CD. Voluntary increases in mesh size for various portions of areas 5CD were suggested as early as 1989 for this fishery and were regulated in 1995 (Table XX). There have also been a number of closures instituted in Hecate Strait to protect spawning biomass (Table XX, Figure XX). The Horseshoe and Reef Island fishing grounds, as well as the shallow Dogfish Bank, were closed from January 1--April 15 in 1991 and 1992. A slightly smaller area was closed for the same months between 1996 and 2001 (Table XX, Figure XX). The closed area was again increased in size in February 2001 to include all of Hecate Strait south of a line between the latitude of Rose Spit and north of a line just south of Reef Island (Figure XX). This closed all of the main cod fishing grounds except Two Peaks/Butterworth. Effective January 27, 2012 the size of the spawning closure was decreased, opening up the eastern side of Hecate Strait to fishing, including the White Rocks ground (Figure 6). Additionally, since 1996, there has been a closure from June 1-July 15 in the shallow portions of Area 5D for the protection of Dungeness crabs during the soft shell stage.

## ASSESSMENT HISTORY

A number of methods have been used to assess Pacific Cod in Hecate Strait since the 1980s. @fournier1983 developed an age-structured model and used it to test for evidence of age-dependent trends in natural mortality, density-dependent natural mortality and catchability, and also for evidence of an environmental factor affecting recruitment. Evidence was found for a relationship between mean sea level at Prince Rupert and recruitment, and also for density-dependent natural mortality. Natural mortality was estimated to be 0.65 y-1 by @fournier1983. This author cautioned about the possibility of confounding among model parameters and systematic data biases that could influence conclusions from the analysis. Estimates of age were obtained from length-frequency analysis [@foucher1982].

Pacific Cod are one of the most difficult Pacific groundfish species to age. Annual rings (annuli) in otoliths, other bony structures and scales are difficult to distinguish from interannual growth checks (@beamish1981; @chilton1982; @roberson2001; @johnston2012). In British Columbia, age compositions have been estimated using length-based approaches, scales, otoliths and, currently, dorsal fin ray sections, although all methods present difficulties. In the absence of reliable direct age data, length-based approaches were used to assess the Hecate Strait stock during the 1990s [@haist1995; 1996; 1997; 1998]. The last of these assessments [@haist1998] suggested that the stock had reached an historic low in 1996, followed by a slight rebound.
Sinclair (2000) used a simple surplus production model fit to a commercial CPUE index to assess the Hecate Strait stock in 2000. This author cited significant structural changes in the fishery during the 1990s resulting in changes in quality and comparability of fishery-dependent data available for the analysis. Changes included voluntary increases in mesh size in the commercial fishery and introduction of individual vessel quotas (IVQs) in 1997 as discussed above. Given the large structural differences between the previous length-based models and the surplus production model, @sinclair2000 noted that results were remarkably comparable until 1994, with three estimated peaks in abundance occurring in 1965, 1974-5 and 1986-7. The two approaches diverged significantly after 1994, with the the length-based Multifan model estimating an increase in biomass while the surplus production model estimated a decline. The differences were interpreted to be due to differences in the indices of abundance used to tune the models, as well as structural model differences.

The differences were interpreted to be due to differences in the indices of abundance used to tune the models, as well as structural model differences.

@sinclair2001 developed a delay-difference model (@deriso1980; @schnute1985; @hilborn1992) containing a Ricker stock-recruit function to assess Pacific Cod in Hecate Strait and off the west coast of Vancouver Island. Recruitment was assumed to be knife-edged at age 2 years. A report card summary of information available for the stock was also developed. The report card analysis from this assessment found biomass indicators to be in the "danger" and "low" categories with potential for increasing recruitment; and reported a general lack of information on other types of indicators for this species in BC. The delay difference model provided a better statistical fit to the data than the previously-applied surplus production model. However, biomass estimates followed a similar trend and magnitude (Figure XX). Retrospective analyses using only data up to 1995 tended to project large increases in biomass that were not predicted when the most recent CPUE data to 2000 were used. The authors noted that the model containing the most recent data predicted the stock to be less productive than the model containing only the earlier data.

The Hecate Strait Pacific Cod stock was last assessed in 2004 [@sinclair2005] using a delay difference model with a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function, based on the view that a Ricker type function with declining recruitment at high stock size was inappropriate for this species. As for the previous assessment, recruitment was assumed to be knife-edged at age 2 years. Model fits were presented with alternative combinations of fixing or estimating natural mortality (M) and the steepness parameter of the stock-recruit function, [@mace1988]. They reported similar fits and biomass estimates for the alternative scenarios but noted very different estimates of equilibrium MSY-based management parameters under alternative combinations of fixed and estimated steepness and M.

Estimates of biomass for the two preferred model runs were considerably higher than estimates from previous assessments (Figure XX). Given structural differences between these and previous models, and differences in the data to which the models were fitted, it is not appropriate to speculate on the source of the large difference in scale among models. However we note that the 2004 assessment was not directly fit to the commercial CPUE data as were previous assessments, but instead was fit to data from the Hecate Strait Assemblage Survey [@choromanski2005] and the Pacific Cod Monitoring Survey [@sinclair2002. There were also differences in:

* weighting of the indices of abundance relative to the mean weight data, to which both sets of models were also fitted; and
* the choice of other fixed variance parameters.

Key uncertainties of the analysis noted by @sinclair2005 were:

* uncertainty in the growth function (model parameters and assumptions of stationarity); and
* the possibility of violating the assumption of knife-edged recruitment at age 2 years, given evidence for younger
  fish in the length composition data from the commercial fishery.

# DATA SOURCES

## DATABASES
Data were extracted from a number of different databases:

**GFBio**
Biological samples and research cruise database. Groundfish Section, Marine
Ecosystems and Aquaculture Division, Science Branch, Fisheries and Oceans Canada,
Pacific Biological Station. This data archive includes most of the groundfish
specimen data collected since the 1950s. It therefore includes data from a variety
of sources (port and at-sea commercial sampling, research survey sampling),
collected using a variety of sampling methods.

**GFCatch**
Canadian trawl landings, 1954-1995 [@rutherford1999].

**PacHarvTrawl**
Canadian trawl landings, 1996 to March 31, 2007. SQL Server database, Groundfish
Section, Marine Ecosystems and Aquaculture Division, Science Branch, Fisheries
and Oceans Canada, Pacific Biological Station.

**GFFOS**
Canadian trawl landings, April 1, 2007 to 2018. View of the Fisheries and Oceans
Canada (DFO) Fishery Operations (FOS) database. Groundfish Section, Marine
Ecosystems and Aquaculture Division, Science Branch, Fisheries and Oceans
Canada, Pacific Biological Station.

## Catch data
Commercial fishing data are presented in this document by fishing year which
includes the period April through March, e.g., fishing year 1956 comprises
the period April 1, 1956 to March 31, 1957. Landings data are presented
separately for Canada and the USA (Tables XX and XX). Combined USA-Canada
landings data were obtained from the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission
reports for 1956-1981 and the USA landed portion was determined by subtracting
the Canadian landed amount from the combined total for each year. In cases where
the difference was negative, the USA landed amount was set to zero
(Tables XX and XX). Canadian data were obtained: from the GFCatch database for
the period 1954-1995 [@rutherford1999]; from the PacHarvest database for the
period 1996-March 31, 2007; and from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) FOS
database for the period April 1, 2007 until the present. The annual size
composition of commercial catches and landings were estimated from port samples
and at-sea samples collected by observers archived in the GFBio database.

### Hecate Strait Assemblage Survey

A series of multi-species groundfish bottom trawl surveys was conducted in
Hecate Strait in May-June of 1984, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998,
2000, 2002, and 2003 @westrheim1984, @fargo1984, @fargo1988,
@wilson1991, @hand1994, @workman1996, @workman1997, @choromanski2002).
The results up to 2000 were reported in the 2001 assessment
[@sinclair2001] and results from 2002 and 2003 were presented in the
2005 assessment [@sinclair2005].

The original design of this survey assigned fishing locations by 10 fm depth
intervals within a 10 nm grid of Hecate Strait. The survey was
post-stratified for the purpose of calculating an abundance index for Pacific
Cod [@sinclair2000]. The post stratification used 10 fm depth intervals for
the entire survey area, thereby treating each depth interval as a single
stratum.

The Hecate Strait Assemblage survey was designed as a systematic
fixed-station survey. Despite attempts to apply post-sampling stratification,
this approach had high survey variance [@sinclair2007]. In 2004 the Hecate
Strait Assemblage survey was discontinued in favour of the Hecate Strait
Synoptic survey (described below).

### Hecate Strait Synoptic Survey

The Hecate Strait synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey is part of a
coordinated set of long-term surveys that together cover the continental shelf
and upper slope of most of the BC coast. The Hecate Strait synoptic survey has
been conducted during May-June, in odd years since 2005. All the synoptic
surveys follow a random depth stratified design. The survey area is divided
into 2 km by 2 km blocks and each block is assigned to one of four depth
strata based on the average bottom depth in the block. The four depth strata
for the Hecate Strait survey are 10--70m, 70--130m, 130--220m, and
220--500m. Each year blocks are randomly selected within each depth strata.
The relative allocation of blocks amongst depth strata was determined by
modeling the expected catches of groundfish and determining the target number
of tows per stratum that would provide the most precise catch rate data for
as many species as possible.

### Queen Charlotte Sound Synoptic Survey

The Queen Charlotte Sound synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey is part of
a coordinated set of long-term surveys that together cover the continental shelf
and upper slope of most of the BC coast. The Queen Charlotte Sound survey has
been conducted in July-August in 2003, 2004 and in odd years since 2005. All
the synoptic surveys follow a random depth stratified design. The survey area
is divided into 2 km by 2 km blocks and each block is assigned to one of four
depth strata based on the average bottom depth in the block. The four depth
strata for the QCS survey are 50--125m, 125--200m, 200--330m,
and 330--500 m. Each year blocks are randomly selected within each depth strata.
In addition, for the purposes of allocating blocks, the QCS survey is divided
into northern and southern spatial strata.

The relative allocation of blocks amongst depth strata was determined by
modeling the expected catches of groundfish and determining the target number
of tows per stratum that would provide the most precise catch rate data for as
many species as possible.

### Survey index of abundance: Surveys, swept area analysis
For all surveys, a swept area estimate of biomass in any year y was obtained
by summing the product of the CPUE and the area surveyed across the surveyed
strata $i$:

\begin{equation}
  B_y = \sum_{i=1}^kC_{y_i}A_i=\sum_{i=1}^kB_{y_i}
  (\#eq:sweptareabiomass)
\end{equation}

where
$C_{y_i}$ = mean CPUE density (kg/km^2^) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$
$A_i$ = area of stratum $i$ (km^2^), and
$B_{y_i}$ = biomass of Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$
$k$ = number of strata

CPUE ($C_{y_i}$) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$ was
calculated as a density in kg/km^2^ by

\begin{equation}
  C_{y_i}=\frac{1}{n_{y_i}} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_{y_i}} \frac{W_{y_i,j}}{D_{y_i,j}w_{y_i,j}}
  (\#eq:sweptareacpue)
\end{equation}

where
$W_{y_i,j}$ = catch weight (kg) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$ and tow $j$
$D_{y_i,j}$ = distance travelled (km) by tow $j$ in stratum $i$ for year $y$
$w_{y_i,j}$ = net opening (km) by tow $j$ in stratum $i$ for year $y$
$n_{y_i}$ = number of tows in stratum $i$

The variance of the survey biomass estimate $V_y$ for Pacific Cod in year $y$
is calculated in kg^2^ as follows:

\begin{equation}
  V_y=\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{\sigma_{y_i}^2A_i^2}{n_{y_i}}=\sum_{i=1}^kV_{y_i}
  (\#eq:sweptareavariance)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ is the variance of the CPUE in $kg^2/km^4$ for year $y$ in
stratum $i$, $V_{y_i}$ is the variance of Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$,
where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ was obtained from bootstrapped samples (see below).

The CV for Pacific Code for each year $y$ was calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  (CV)_y=\frac{{V_y}^{1/2}}{B_y}
  (\#eq:sweptareacv)
\end{equation}

where $(CV)_y$ is the CV for year $y$.

One thousand bootstrap replicates with replacement were constructed from the
survey data to estimate bias corrected 95% confidence regions for each survey
year [@efron1982].

## COMMERCIAL ANNUAL MEAN WEIGHT DATA

The methodology for calculating the mean weight of Pacific Cod from commercial
vessels for the years 1956--2017 is presented in Appendix XX.

## LENGTH DATA

This assessment does not attempt to analyze length-frequency data in detail,
but does present length-frequencies as auxiliary information.

Length-frequencies from commercial vessels for the years 1996-2017 are
presented in Appendix XX. The sample data were extracted from the GFBio, using
the criteria given in Table XX. Examination of the sample length frequencies
revealed 7 samples that were coded as being Pacific Cod but the size
composition was uncharacteristic of the species. These samples, listed in
Table XX, were eliminated from the analysis.

Length data for all Pacific Cod from the Hecate Strait assemblage survey,
Hecate Strait synoptic survey and Queen Charlotte Sound synoptic survey were
extracted and are presented in Appendix XX. All samples taken on these
surveys were taken from unsorted catches, i.e., specimens were not selected
based on size or sex.

As a general rule the survey retains smaller fish than the commercial
vessels and, in particular, there was evidence of a large proportion of
small (< 20 cm) fish in Hecate Strait in 2013 (Figure XX). A visual assessment
of the commercial length frequencies for Area 5CD (Figure XX) showed some
evidence of smaller fish in 1999, 2003 and 2007. There was no indication of
small (< 20 cm) fish in the recent Queen Charlotte Sound synoptic surveys
(Figure XX). Commercial length-frequencies from Area 5AB indicated large
proportions of smaller fish in 2000 and 2007 (Figure XX).

It should be noted in any visual assessment of commercial length-frequency
data that an increase in frequency of small fish could be explained by a
large recruitment event, a change in selectivity, the introduction of
onboard observers, or an artefact of sampling. Changes in selectivity can
result from changes to the fishing gear (e.g., mesh size) or changes in
fishing location (e.g., depth).
