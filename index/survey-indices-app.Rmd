# FISHERY-INDEPENDENT INDICES OF ABUNDANCE

## CANADIAN SURVEYS

### HECATE STRAIT ASSEMBLAGE SURVEY

A series of multi-species groundfish bottom trawl surveys was conducted in
Hecate Strait in May-June of 1984, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998,
2000, 2002, and 2003 @westrheim1984, @fargo1984, @fargo1988,
@wilson1991, @hand1994, @workman1996, @workman1997, @choromanski2002).
The results up to 2000 were reported in the 2001 assessment
[@sinclair2001] and results from 2002 and 2003 were presented in the
2005 assessment [@sinclair2005].

The original design of this survey assigned fishing locations by 10 fm depth
intervals within a 10 nm grid of Hecate Strait. The survey was
post-stratified for the purpose of calculating an abundance index for Pacific
Cod [@sinclair2000]. The post stratification used 10 fm depth intervals for
the entire survey area, thereby treating each depth interval as a single
stratum.

The Hecate Strait Assemblage survey was designed as a systematic
fixed-station survey. Despite attempts to apply post-sampling stratification,
this approach had high survey variance [@sinclair2007]. In 2004 the Hecate
Strait Assemblage survey was discontinued in favour of the Hecate Strait
Synoptic survey (described below).

### HECATE STRAIT SYNOPTIC SURVEY

The Hecate Strait synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey is part of a
coordinated set of long-term surveys that together cover the continental shelf
and upper slope of most of the BC coast. The Hecate Strait synoptic survey has
been conducted during May-June, in odd years since 2005. All the synoptic
surveys follow a random depth stratified design. The survey area is divided
into 2 km by 2 km blocks and each block is assigned to one of four depth
strata based on the average bottom depth in the block. The four depth strata
for the Hecate Strait survey are 10--70m, 70--130m, 130--220m, and
220--500m. Each year blocks are randomly selected within each depth strata.
For this survey and the other synoptic surveys discussed below, the relative
allocation of blocks amongst depth strata was determined by modeling the
expected catches of groundfish and determining the target number of tows per
stratum that would provide the most precise catch rate data for as many species
as possible.

*TODO: presumably there is some trade off here with time and cost otherwise we
would sample infinite blocks*

### QUEEN CHARLOTTE SOUND SYNOPTIC SURVEY

The Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey has been
conducted in July--August in 2003, 2004, and in odd years since 2005. The four
depth strata for the QCS survey are 50--125m, 125--200m, 200--330m, and
330--500 m. Each year blocks are randomly selected within each depth strata. In
addition, for the purposes of allocating blocks, the QCS survey is divided into
northern and southern spatial strata.

### WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND SYNOPTIC SURVEY

The West Coast Vancouver Island synoptic bottom trawl survey was first
conducted in 2004 and is conducted in alternating (even-numbered) years on
a chartered commercial trawler. The survey area is off the west coast of
Vancouver Island from approximately 49$^\circ$ 12$^\prime$ to 50$^\circ$
36$^\prime$ North latitude and approximately 124$^\circ$ 48$^\prime$ to
128$^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ West longitude. The southern boundary is contiguous
with the Canada/U.S. boundary. The survey has a single aerial stratum in
Pacific Fishery Management Area regions 3C and 3D separated into four depth
strata: 50--125m; 125--200m; 200--330m; and 330--500m. Approximately 150 to 180
4 km^2^ blocks are selected randomly among the four depth strata when
conducting each survey.

### SWEPT AREA ANALYSIS

For all Canadian surveys, a swept area estimate of biomass in any year $y$ was
obtained by summing the product of the CPUE and the area surveyed across the
surveyed strata $i$:

\begin{equation}
  B_y = \sum_{i=1}^kC_{y_i}A_i=\sum_{i=1}^kB_{y_i}
  (\#eq:sweptareabiomass)
\end{equation}

where
$C_{y_i}$ = mean CPUE density (kg/km^2^) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$,
$A_i$ = area of stratum $i$ (km^2^),
$B_{y_i}$ = biomass of Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$, and
$k$ = number of strata.

CPUE ($C_{y_i}$) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$ was calculated as
a density in kg/km^2^ by

\begin{equation}
  C_{y_i}=\frac{1}{n_{y_i}} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_{y_i}} \frac{W_{y_i,j}}{D_{y_i,j}w_{y_i,j}}
  (\#eq:sweptareacpue)
\end{equation}

where
$W_{y_i,j}$ = catch weight (kg) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$ and tow $j$,
$D_{y_i,j}$ = distance travelled (km) by tow $j$ in stratum $i$ for year $y$,
$w_{y_i,j}$ = net opening (km) by tow $j$ in stratum $i$ for year $y$, and
$n_{y_i}$ = number of tows in stratum $i$.

The variance of the survey biomass estimate $V_y$ for Pacific Cod in year $y$
was calculated in kg^2^ as follows:

\begin{equation}
  V_y=\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{\sigma_{y_i}^2A_i^2}{n_{y_i}}=\sum_{i=1}^kV_{y_i}
  (\#eq:sweptareavariance)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ is the variance of the CPUE in $kg^2/km^4$ for year $y$ in
stratum $i$, $V_{y_i}$ is the variance of Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$,
and where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ was obtained from bootstrapped samples (see below).

The CV for Pacific Cod for each year $y$ was calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  (CV)_y=\frac{{V_y}^{1/2}}{B_y}
  (\#eq:sweptareacv)
\end{equation}

where $(CV)_y$ is the CV for year $y$.

One thousand bootstrap replicates with replacement were constructed from the
survey data to estimate bias corrected 95% confidence intervals for each survey
year [@efron1982].

## NMFS TRIENNIAL SURVEY (IN CANADIAN WATERS)

A relative abundance index was developed for Area 3CD from data from the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Triennial survey operated off the
lower half of Vancouver Island.

###  Data selection

Tow-by-tow data from the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
triennial survey covering the Vancouver INPFC (International North
Pacific Fisheries Commission) region were provided by Mark Wilkins
(NMFS, pers. comm.) for the seven years that the survey worked in BC
waters (Table A.1; 1980: Figure A.1; 1983: Figure B.2; 1989: Figure B.3;
1992: Figure B.4; 1995: Figure B.5; 1998: Figure B.6; 2001: Figure B.7).
These tows were assigned to strata by the NMFS, but the size and
definition of these strata have changed over the life of the survey
(Table B.2). The NMFS survey database also identified in which country
the tow was located. This information was plotted and checked against
the accepted Canada/USA marine boundary: all tows appeared to be
appropriately located with respect to country, based on the tow start
position (Figure A.1 to Figure B.7). The NMFS designations were accepted
for tows located near the marine border.

All usable tows had an associated median net width (with 1-99%
quantiles) of 13.4 (11.3-15.7) m and median distance travelled of 2.8
(1.4-3.5) km, allowing for the calculation of the area swept by each
tow. Biomass indices and the associated analytical CVs for Pacific Cod
were calculated for the total Vancouver INPFC region and for each of the
Canadian- and US-Vancouver sub-regions, using appropriate area estimates
for each stratum and year (Table B.2). Strata that were not surveyed
consistently in all seven years of the survey were dropped from the
analysis (Table A.1; Table B.2), allowing the remaining data to provide
a comparable set of data for each year (Table B.3).

Table A.1. Number of tows by stratum and by survey year for the NFMS
triennial survey. Strata coloured grey have been excluded from the
analysis due to incomplete coverage across the seven survey years or
were from locations outside the Vancouver INPFC area (Table B.2).

```{r surv-tri-strata-table, warning=FALSE}
tri_str <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data/triennial-strata.csv"))
names(tri_str) <- gsub("_1", "", names(tri_str))
tri_to_shade <- which(tri_str$Shade == 1)
tri_str$Shade <- NULL
for (i in seq_along(names(tri_str))) {
  tri_str[,i][is.na(tri_str[,i])] <- ""
}
knitr::kable(tri_str,
    caption = "Number of tows by stratum and by survey year for the NFMS triennial survey. Strata coloured grey have been excluded from the analysis due to incomplete coverage across the seven survey years or were from locations outside the Vancouver INPFC area.",
    booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 9)
```

The stratum definitions used in the 1980 and 1983 surveys were different
than those used in subsequent surveys, particularly in Canadian waters
(Table B.3). Therefore, the 1980 and 1983 indices were scaled up by the
ratio (9166 km^2^ / 7399 km^2^ = 1.24) of the total stratum areas
relative to the 1989 and later surveys so that the coverage from the
first two surveys would be comparable to the surveys conducted from 1989
onwards. The tow density was much higher in US waters although the
overall number of tows was approximately the same for each country
(Table B.3). This occurs because the size of the total area fished in
the INPFC Vancouver area was about twice as large in Canadian waters
than in US waters (Table B.3). Note that the northern extension of the
survey has varied from year to year (Figure A.1 to Figure B.7), but this
difference has been compensated for by using a constant survey area for
all years and assuming that catch rates in the unsampled areas were the
same as in the sampled area.

Table B.2. Stratum definitions by year used in the NMFS triennial survey
to separate the survey results by country and by INPFC area. Stratum
definitions in grey are those strata which have been excluded from the
final analysis due to incomplete coverage across the seven survey years
or because the locations were outside the Vancouver INPFC area.

A reviewer from NOAA for Yellowtail Rockfish in 2014 (DFO 2015) noted
that a number of the early Triennial survey tows had been deemed "water
hauls" (catching no fish or invertebrates) and should be discarded. The
tows used to estimate relative Pacific Cod biomass (summarised in
Table B.3) exclude these water haul tows.

Table B.3. Number of usable tows performed and area surveyed in the
INPFC Vancouver region separated by the international border between
Canada and the United States. Strata 18N, 28N, 37, 38 and 39 (Table B.2)
were dropped from this analysis as they were not consistently conducted
over the survey period. All strata occurring in the Columbia INPFC
region (17S and 27S; Table B.2) were also dropped.

###  Methods

The data were analysed using the equations in Section A.1. When
calculating the variance for this survey, it was assumed that the
variance and CPUE within any stratum were equal, even for strata that
were split by the Canada/USA border. The total biomass within a stratum
that straddled the border was split between the two countries by the
ratio of the relative area within each country:

Eq. B.7 ,

where = area (km^2^) within country *c* in year *y* and stratum *i*.

The variance for that part of stratum *i* within country *c* was
calculated as being in proportion to the ratio of the square of the area
within each country *c* relative to the total area of stratum *i*. This
assumption resulted in the CVs within each country stratum being the
same as the CV in the entire stratum:

Eq. B.8 .

The partial variance for country *c* was used in Eq. B.5 instead of the
total variance in the stratum when calculating the variance for the
total biomass in Canadian or American waters. CVs were calculated as in
Eq. B.6.

The biomass estimates Eq. B.4 and the associated standard errors were
adjusted to a constant area covered using the ratios of area surveyed
provided in Table B.3. This was required to adjust the Canadian biomass
estimates for 1980 and 1983 to account for the smaller area surveyed in
those years compared to the succeeding surveys. he 1980 and 1983 biomass
estimates from Canadian waters were consequently multiplied by the ratio
1.24 (= 9166 km^2^ / 7399 km^2^) to make them equivalent to the coverage
of the surveys from 1989 onwards.

Biomass estimates were bootstrapped for 1000 random draws with
replacement to obtain bias-corrected (Efron 1982) 95% confidence
intervals for each year and for three area categories (total Vancouver
region, Canadian-Vancouver only and US-Vancouver only) based on the
distribution of biomass estimates and using the above equations.

Catch and effort data for strata \(i\) in year \(y\) yield catch per unit effort (CPUE) values\({U_{yi}}\). Given a set of data \(\left\{ {{C_{yij}},{E_{yij}}} \right\}\) for tows\(j = 1, \ldots ,{n_{yi}}\),

\begin{equation}
{U_{yi}} = \frac{1}{{{n_{yi}}}}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{n_{yi}}} {\frac{{{C_{yij}}}}{{{E_{yij}}}}},
\end{equation}

where \({C_{yij}}\) = catch (kg) in tow \(j\), stratum \(i\), year \(y\);
\({E_{yij}}\) = effort (h) in tow \(j\), stratum \(i\), year \(y\); and
\({n_{yi}}\)  = number of tows in stratum \(i\), year \(y\).

CPUE values \({U_{yi}}\) convert to CPUE densities \({\delta _{yi}}\) (kg/km2) using:

\begin{equation}
{\delta _{yi}} = \frac{1}{{vw}}{U_{yi}},
\end{equation}

where \(v\) = average vessel speed (km/h) and
\(w\) = average net width (km).

Alternatively, if vessel information exists for every tow, CPUE density can be expressed

\begin{equation}
{\delta _{yi}} = \frac{1}{{{n_{yi}}}}\,\,\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{n_{yi}}} {\,\frac{{{C_{yij}}}}{{{D_{yij}}{w_{yij}}}}},
\end{equation}

where \({C_{yij}}\) = catch weight (kg) for tow \(j\), stratum \(i\), year \(y\);
\({D_{yij}}\) = distance travelled (km) for tow\(j\), stratum\(i\), year\(y\);
\({w_{yij}}\) = net opening (km) for tow\(j\), stratum\(i\), year\(y\); and
\({n_{yi}}\)  = number of tows in stratum\(i\), year\(y\).

The annual biomass estimate is then the sum of the product of CPUE densities and bottom areas across \(m\) strata:

\begin{equation}
{B_y} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {{\delta _{yi}}{A_i}}  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {{B_{yi}}},
\end{equation}

where \({\delta _{yi}}\)  = mean CPUE density (kg/km2) for stratum \(i\), year \(y\);
  \({A_i}\) = area (km2) of stratum\(i\);
  \({B_{yi}}\)  = biomass (kg) for stratum\(i\), year\(y\); and
  \(m\) = number of strata.

The variance of the survey biomass estimate \({V_y}\) (kg2) follows:

\begin{equation}
{V_y} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {\frac{{\sigma _{yi}^2A_i^2}}{{{n_{yi}}}}\,}  = \,\,\,\sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {{V_{yi}}},
\end{equation}

where   \(\sigma _{yi}^2\)  = variance of CPUE density (kg2/km4) for
stratum \(i\), year \(y\) and
\({V_{yi}}\)  = variance of the biomass estimate (kg2) for
stratum\(i\), year \(y\).

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the annual biomass estimate for year \(y\) is

\begin{equation}
C{V_y} = \frac{{\sqrt {\,{V_y}} }}{{{B_y}}}.
\end{equation}

### Results

Pacific Cod (PAC) are characterised with most catches taken along the
shelf edge and in the deep gully entering Juan de Fuca Strait (e.g.,
Figure A.1 and Figure B.2). A more consistent biomass estimate was
obtained by excluding deep strata that were not covered in the earlier
surveys (Table B.2). Figure B.8 shows that this species was mainly found
between 57 and 256 m (1 and 99% quantiles of \(bottom\_depth\)), with
infrequent observations at depths up to 326 m which means that the
deeper strata (\>367 m) are not needed to monitor PAC. Note that the
deep strata which were not used in the biomass estimation are included
in Figure B.8.
