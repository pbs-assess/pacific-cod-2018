# Species overview

- Pacific Cod are distributed from California, through waters of BC, Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea to Russia, Korea, Japan and China.

- May be genetically distinct from other areas.

- In BC the maximum age is 10–11 yr and maximum size is 100 cm.

- Pacific Cod are demersal spawners; spawning most likely occurs from February to March.

---

# Commercial Fishery

- Pacific Cod are caught almost entirely by bottom trawl.

- Mainly captured at depths less than 300 m.

- Annual reported catches have shown considerable variability since the beginning of the time series in 1956.

# Commercial Fishery Data

### Summarized by fishing year, April 1 to March 31

### Canadian catches:

- Earliest data from summaries of trawl fishing, 1945. Landings only, recorded by PMFC area (e.g., 5A, 5C) and month.

- GFCatch contains landed catches and some limited discards for 1954-1995.

- PacharvTrawl contains catches and discards for 1996-March 2007. Reliable statistics, largely from at-sea observer logbooks.

- FOS contains catches  and discards for April 2007-present. Reliable statistics, largely from at-sea observer logbooks.

# Commercial Fishery Data

### Summarized by fishing year, April 1 to March 31

### USA catches:

- Obtained from PMFC Data Series — combined Canadian and USA landings by PMFC area and month

- USA landings obtained by subtracting the Canadian portion recorded in GFCatch

- Some discrepancies as combined landings were sometimes less than the Canadian amount

- USA catch was then set to zero

# Fishery Catch for Area 5ABCD

```{r catch.5abcd}
make.catches.plot(catch.5, every = 5, last.yr = 2018)
```

???

Total catches of Pacific Cod during the period 1956-2017 in Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound. Catches represent the sum of landings from US and Canadian vessels and estimated at-sea releases from Canadian vessels.

---

# Fishery Catch for Area 3CD

```{r catch.3cd, every = 5, last.yr = 2018}
make.catches.plot(catch.3)
```

???

Total catches of Pacific Cod during the period 1956-2017 off the West Coast of Vancouver Island. Catches represent the sum of landings from US and Canadian vessels and estimated at-sea releases from Canadian vessels.

# Research Surveys

- Hecate Strait Assemblage Survey 1984-2003

- Hecate Strait Pacific Cod Monitoring Survey 2002-2004

- Hecate Strait Synoptic Survey 2005-2017

### Area 3CD

# Survey indices of abundance

- For all surveys, a swept area estimate of biomass in any year y was obtained by summing the product of the CPUE and the area surveyed across the surveyed strata *i*.

- Variance of biomass estimate calculated.

- One thousand bootstrap replicates with replacement constructed to estimate bias corrected 95% confidence levels for each survey year.

# Commercial Length Data

Criteria for length data extraction for use in estimating size composition of bottom trawl catches:

- Commercial trips, bottom trawl only

- By fishing year, April 1 to March 31, based on fishing event haul date/time

- Eliminated 7 samples that may have been tomcod

# Probable age-frequency in commercial catch (draft only)

- A simple age-length key was developed, based on age samples from synoptic surveys, 2007 - 2011

- Observed lengths in the commercial fishery were assigned ages, based on probabilities in the age-length key

- This work is draft only, and based on small sample sizes, but does indicate a high proportion of age-2 fish in the commercial fishery
