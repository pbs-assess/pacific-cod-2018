# Species overview
- .xlarge[Pacific Cod are distributed from California, through waters of BC, Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea to Russia, Korea, Japan and China.]

- May be genetically distinct from other areas.

- In BC the maximum age is 10-11 yr and maximum size is 100 cm.

- Pacific Cod are demersal spawners; spawning most likely occurs during February to March.

---
# Commercial Fishery

- Pacific Cod are caught almost entirely by bottom trawl.

- Mainly captured at depths less than 150 m.

- Annual reported catches have shown considerable variability since the beginning of the time series in 1956.

# Commercial Fishery Data

### Summarized by fishing year, April 1 to March 31

###Canadian catches:
- Earliest data from summaries of trawl fishing, 1945. Landings only, recorded by PMFC area (e.g., 5A, 5C) and month.
- GFCatch contains landed catches and some limited discards for 1954-1995.
- PacharvTrawl contains catches and discards for 1996-March 2007. Reliable statistics, largely from at-sea observer logbooks.
- FOS contains catches  and discards for April 2007-present. Reliable statistics, largely from at-sea observer logbooks.

###USA catches:
- Obtained from PMFC Data Series -- combined Canadian and USA landings by PMFC area and month. USA landings obtained by subtracting the Canadian portion recorded in GFCatch. Some discrepancies as combined landings were sometimes less than the Canadian amount. In these cases the USA catch was set to zero.
