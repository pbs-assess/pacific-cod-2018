READresDocTemplate.txt - template for Latex Res Doc. Andrew Edwards.

This is a guide to getting Latex-produced documents published by CSAS.

My files aren't completely 'cleaned up', but the example should run.
 There are some commented parts that I've left in in case they're
 useful (or I'm not sure if I can completely delete them).

There are some packages that need to be included (though some
 will just be specific to our assessment, so you could try
 commenting some out if necessary).

HOW TO WRITE A WORKING PAPER (FOR REVIEW AT A CSAS MEETING) IN LATEX
********************************************************************

[Fuller descriptions of the files are given below.]

1. Start with POP3CDexample.tex as a template. It should run okay (as
 long as the mainDoc/ folders are there, as they should be if you you just
 unzip the .7z file).

2. The resDocSty.sty file deals with the formatting to satisfy the CSAS
 requirements. The requirements change each year, so this may need to be 
 updated. 

3. The resDoc.bst file deals with formatting the bibliography. See below
 for details regarding the ordering of multi-author papers (I ended up
 manually doing that rather than figure it out in the .bst file).

4. The preamble (first 6 pages: title page etc., before the text starts) 
 needs to be in 
 Word - cover page is too hard to replicate in Latex, and CSAS will give the
 French translations. For submitting the Working Paper (to be peer-reviewed)
 you could either stick with the dummy title page etc. in the latex version,
 or replace it with the Word version. So make a .pdf from the latex and a .pdf
 from the .doc, and just replace the relevant latex .pdf pages (the preamble)
 with the relevant Word .pdf pages. For the Working Paper you 
 may want to keep the Latex Table of Contents etc., and you won't have a French
 resume anyway yet.

5. So, for peer review submit a .pdf. It doesn't need to be Web Accessible etc.


HOW TO FINALISE THE RESEARCH DOCUMENT
*************************************

1. Revise the text etc. due to reviewers' comments; finalise it all. IF you 
   can get latex to automatically add "alternate text" for figures and tables, 
   then do so (and let me know!). We haven't looked into it at all, but I'm 
   sure somebody's done that. This will save time at a later stage.

   Make a .pdf of it all. We had one Appendix in Word still (which was a pain)
   and so had to do some manual stitching together.

2. Edit the Word file (POP3CDresDocPreamble.doc, or latest version from
   local CSAS office as it seems to change annually), though you won't have
   French yet. I did the Word Table of Contents manually, based on the automated
   Latex one. 

3. Make a .pdf of all your Latex, and a .pdf of the Preamble, and replace
   the latex preamble pages with the correct Word version.

4. Get local CSAS office to check formatting is okay; it won't be Web Accessible.

5. Send to CSAS in Ottawa so they can edit the Preamble Word file, with French
   translations, document numbers and date of publication. Note that they now
   put a month of publication on the front page (and there's a three-week delay
   as things have to go through a high-level Ottawa office for final sign 
   off). So you need sufficient time to do the Web Accessibility stuff.

6. Get the Word preamble back from Ottawa. Then you can stitch that together
   with your Latex .pdf file. 

7. So you have a complete finalised document, which now needs to be made 'Web
   Accessible'......

HOW TO MAKE THE FINAL .pdf WEB ACCESSIBLE
*****************************************

There ar no guarantees on my advice, but this seemed to get there in the end. It took me a while to figure out the steps (and I don't claim to fully understand it all), but my two Res Docs (2013/092 and 2013/093) were accepted and published by CSAS in March 2014. Once I'd got the first one approved and kept track of the steps, I think the second one took only 2 hours to make web accessible.

1. So if you had done your Res Doc in Word, your CSAS office would do this stage. 
  But of course you'd still be manually inserting figures into your Word file ;) 

  Through trial and error I figured out the following, which will hopefully work
  for you. Remember, it's still better than someone messing up all your equations
  in a 100+ page Word file, which has happened in the past. 
  
2. Web accessibility, as far as I can tell, is basically making the .pdf
   accessible to people who want to use a screen reader to 'listen' to it. I
   actually use the 'read out loud' feature in Adobe to proof-read my own papers
   The issues requiring attention are basically: 
   i) everything needs to be 'tagged' so that the screen knows whether it is
      text or not.
  ii) figures (plus I did tables) that cannot be read, need 'alternate text'. 
      Turns out this can just be 'Figure 7' etc., not a full description of
      the figure (which would obviously take a thousand words...)
   Tagging almost everything can be done automatically, but alternate text
    has to be added manually (until we figure out how to automate it in Latex).
 
   A Quick Check ( Advanced - Accessibility - Quick Check) on my ...Submit.pdf 
    file before I did any tagging, said that it had logical structure but was
    not tagged, as expected. It's good to start with everything untagged I think.

3. I did the following on Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional. Repeatedly
   save each iteration with a new filename in case you have to go back a stage;
   you can't simply 'undo' these things. 

4. Add tags - click Advanced, Accessibility, Add tags. That automatically adds 
   tags to the whole document.

5. Check page by page with original finalised .pdf that any figures didn't get messed up - for ours, some colours got washed out (especially green), and some filled circles became open. Manually replace those pages from the original .pdf, and manually add tags to those pages.

  To Manually add tags:
Alt-T-A-G [Tools - Adv Editing - touch up reading tool] add tags to figures, caption, text and footer(=background,  which I'm guessing is correct since footers don't show up as tags for other pages). Draw round the whole thing to be tagged, and choose which type of tag.

For some complicated tables you may have to re-tag, for example including any table footnotes. Some figures don't automatically include '/' and other symbols. Just re-tag around the whole thing and make a figure. Add TOC as a tag (this may be done automatically). Do title page etc. as Text, I don't think you do anything with the Fisheries and Oceans logo or the 'Canada' in the bottom-right corner of the cover page (they could not be manually tagged in one of my Res Docs ('Canada' would move to the other corner). Don't tag something as a formula - I tried this for Word equations and they all tumbled down to the bottom of the page..


Add alternate text to all figures. You can just right-click on each figure and add the alternate text - just say "Figure 5" for Figure 5, etc.. I did this, which is quicker once you get going. If you prefer just using the keyboard (especially if you have a programmable keyboard):

- View - Navigation Panels - Tags   - Highlight Content

- Expand logical structure, find the first real figure. Have it highlighted. Click on options. Click on Highlight Content (shows what the Tag refers to).

- Click Options again, then
 [Programmed as f5 on keyboard]:
  P (for properties)
  Alt-r
  Figure     [i.e. type "Figure " for the alternate text]. 

Then type in Figure number.
 [Programmed as f4]:
  Alt c
  Down arrow (to go to next figure in  Tags Panel
Keep scrolling down with arrow key to next real figure.
Click on Options.
Repeat from [Programmed as f5 on keyboard]

Some figures have multiple panels that get tagged separately - for those I usually retagged them all with the same figure name.

6. Do a Quick Check: Advanced, Accessibility, Quick Check. I think it should now pass this (basically, everything is tagged).

7. Save as filenameReport.pdf, then run Full check - make sure you tell it the right directory that you want to save the report in, and check options 1,4,6 (in Adobe 8), which are: Alt text descriptions are provided; All content is provided in the document structure; Tab order is consistent within the structure order. I had chosen these, but I think you can probably just do number 1, as the alternate text is what CSAS seems concerned with.

This pops up a summary, plus gives full details in filenameReport.pdf and ..html.

8. Basically you want to end up with 0 'images with no alternate text' and 0 'figure elements with no alternate text'. 

The ..Report.pdf has comments that tell you what needs correcting. Just worry about the images/figures with no alternate text - find them in the filename.pdf document and add alt text to them (right-click figure). 

In the preamble page 2 the recycle symbol was giving me grief as a figure, so I just made one big box around everything and called it text.

There already seems to be a TOC tag but it clicking on a heading/page number doesn't seem to jump to that page. Added another TOC tag (using Tag panel: View, Navigation Panels, Tags [since TOC doesn't seem to be an option with Alt-T-A-G] and highlight whole page (except footer)) to TOC and it seemed to automatically allow clicking to the correct page.

Sometimes a figure might give an error - numbers on an axis may be tagged as text instead of part of the figure - just create a new figure tag around the whole thing, which seems to replace the old tags.

Sometimes bits of an axis label may not work - e.g. / got tagged as it's own figure, so just add alt text to it or retag the whole figure.

Footnotes under tables cause problems, just re-tag the whole thing (including footnote) as a table.

It seems Word equations come out as individual figures, but if you highlight a whole page (to call it one big figure), all the equations tumble down into a pile in the bottom-right corner (!). So you have to right-click each one and add alt text. Latex equations didn't need to be fixed (except for two minor symbols that strangely got tagged as figures).

CSAS office asked me to add bookmarks. To add bookmarks, you just need to select the text and do CTRL + B, then if you have sub-titles, you will need to drag them under their main title, and that can be a bit tricky at first. Rowan said to 'fit page' for each bookmark.  I can't get Adobe Acrobat 8 to show bookmark panel, and I think in the end it was automatically done in the .pdf.


FILES
*****

resDocSty.sty - this is the style file that sets some of the 
 formatting. I keep mine in C:\andy\latex\myStyleFiles\tex\latex\misc
 (which is in my path). I haven't tidied it up as
 much as I could, and it may contain a few superflous things 
 (e.g. the tocloft package doesn't get used).

POP3CDexample.tex - this should work. It's based on:

POP3CDresDoc.tex which was my final version, but needs figures
 etc. to be in the right directories (so can't be run on other
 people's computers).

mainDoc/  folder has a .tex file plus some figures, that gets called
 from POP3CDexample.tex
appD-Biology/ folder is an appendix
appF-Eqns/ folder is another appendix. 

This is for our Pacific Ocean Perch (2014) Research Document:
 Edwards, A.M., Haigh, R. and Starr, P.J. 2014. Pacific Ocean Perch 
  (Sebastes alutus) stock assessment for the west coast of Vancouver
   Island, British Columbia. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 
   2013/093: vi + 135 p.

POP3CDresDocSubmit.pdf is the final submitted  version (approved
 by our local CSAS office).

POP3CDresDocSubmitAccess9.pdf is the final version, with Web
 Accessibility, as accepted by the CSAS office. 

POP3CDresDocPreamble.doc is the preamble (first 6 pages) as
 .doc so that CSAS office can edit it. Unfortunately that includes
 the Table of Contents, which I did in Latex for submitting the 
 working paper, and then just did manually in Word (based on a 
 previous one we had) for the final Res Doc.

There are appendices that are kept in separate folders (like when writing
 a thesis). My figures are all in the original R directories, so
 I've just included a few stand alone figures and some text that should
 work (though it won't correctly reference figure numbers)

abbrev4.bib - my ongoing (large!) bibliography file.

resDoc.bst - bib style file for the references. One thing I couldn't
 get to work was the ordering of multi-author papers (CJFAS rules).
 See CSAPbibRules.pdf. 

 I ended up just manually editing the .bbl file at the end, so just
 don't run bibtex after that. For example, I had to do
 Edwards et al. 2012b before 2013
 Olsen et al. 1997 before 2008
 Schnute and Richards before Schnute et al. 2001
 Westrheim et al. 1968 before 1972.


In case you need it, we had a few figures that we couldn't produce
 properly as postscript, but as .png or .pdf. For that we constructed
 POP3CDReplace.tex, and ran
 texi2dvi --pdf POP3CDReplace.tex
  and replaced the relavant pages in the final .pdf.
 (I run latex the old way - latex **.tex, dvips **
  so I can view the postscript output in ghostview, which
  automatically refreshes), and then ps2pdf **.ps to make
  a final .pdf.
 
I had a working paper file POP3CDwp.tex, that then became 
 POP3CDresDoc.tex for doing revisions. To compare versions 
 I ran:

latexdiff --flatten POP3CDwp3.tex POP3CDresDoc.tex > POP3CDdiff.tex

which actually worked (and is the reason I use \input instead
 of \subimport).

Please ask any questions. We did two companion assessments
 at once, and using Sweave and Latex for a lot of the output saved
 a lot of time, despite the extra work required at the end for
 Web Accessibility. Plus the Sweave approach has been used  in
 two subsequent assessment.
